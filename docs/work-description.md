## Crawling and Generating Lucene Index

#### Step. 1 - Crawl all web Urls from AOL dataset
  * There are **1,632,797** URLs in AOL dataset and we have crawled **1,051,483** wchich is **64.4%** of the total number of URLs. Remaining URLs are either dead, broken or moved permanently to another URL. List of all the URLs can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/a/virginia.edu/file/d/0B8ZGlkqDw7hFNkc0c0p1OVF2YTA/view).

  We have stored the crawled data in one xml file and the format of the file looks like below.

  ```xml
