# Intent aware Privacy Protection in Personalized Web Search

<p align="justify">
To improve our previous project titled as, [Topic-based-Privacy-Protection-in-PWS](https://github.com/wasiahmad/Topic-based-Privacy-Protection-in-PWS), we have proposed a new client-centered approach based on hierarchically organized n-gram language models. One of the major accomplishments of this work is, it can handle sequentially edited user queries during a search session. Besides we have introduced a better technique to approximate query specificity which maintains same specificity level in cover queries similar to original query. Moreover, since this approach works in a hierarchical fashion, it is more effective in capturing user intent and also improves the plausibility of the generated cover queries through maintaining intent consistency.
